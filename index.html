    <h2>My Journal as I go through NSS</h2>
    <h1>Day 1</h1>
    <p>Today was my first day of class at NSS. I installed a lot of things on my computer without
        really knowing what I was doing. Lets hope this is a legit software school and not a massive phishing operation.
         I really wish terminal basics were part of the pre-work so I would know what I'm doing before the
         last 30 minutes of class. Baby steps I guess!
    </p>
    <p>Tune in tomorrow for more <em>essential</em> blog content straight out of Music City USA! </p>

    <h1>Day 2</h1>
    <p>I think I'm getting the hang of navigating the terminal and using github. We are moving past that now and have started appending to the DOM.
        The DOM completely lost me during the pre-work (thanks Guil), but I'm starting to see how it works. Cohort 25 showed us
        what they have been working on and gave us a taste of whats to come. They were really encouraging and helpful even though I could
        barely tell what they were doing. <em>With time everything will make sense</em>.
